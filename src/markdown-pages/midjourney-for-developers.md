# Midjourney for developers

Midjourney is an AI-powered tool that generates images and videos based on user prompts. It's a fantastic tool for developers who want to add unique visuals to their projects without spending hours creating them from scratch. With Midjourney, you can quickly generate images that match your project's theme or add a creative twist to your website or app. Here's a cheat sheet of essential Midjourney parameters and commands to help you get started.

## Composition

Midjourney offers seven composition options for your images:

1.  Full body view
2.  Ultra-wide shot
3.  Portrait
4.  Macro shot
5.  Headshot
6.  Extreme close-up
7.  Sideview

## Lighting

Lighting can significantly impact an image's mood and tone. Midjourney offers six lighting options:

1.  Soft lighting
2.  Hard lighting
3.  Morning lighting
4.  Cold lighting/neon cold lighting
5.  Volumetric lighting
6.  Fluorescent lighting

## Essential Parameters

Midjourney has three essential parameters you need to set:

1.  Aspect Ratio: `--ar:width-height`
2.  Image Weight: How much inspiration to take from an image or text prompt (the default is 0.25). Use `--iw` to set the value.
3.  Excluding an object from the image: Use `--no object` to exclude an object from the image.

## Advanced Parameters

Midjourney also has several advanced parameters to help you fine-tune your images:

-   Explore the versions of Midjourney using `--v`.
-   Use `--hd` for more detailed and higher resolution images.
-   Use `--uplight` to upscale images with fewer details and textures (e.g., faces).
-   Use `--seed` for consistency between image generations. You can also use `--sameseed` to ensure all four generated images have the same consistency.
-   Use `--s 0-60000` to stylize an image.
-   Use `--q 0~2` to adjust the quality (default is 1).

## Video Export & Emojis Reactions

If you want to create a video of your generated art, add the `--video` parameter. You can also add a reaction by sending an envelope emoji, X, or Star.

## Commands

Midjourney offers several useful commands:

-   `/fast` generates a quick image.
-   `/relax` generates an image at a slower pace.
-   `/info` provides information about Midjourney.
-   `/help` provides help with Midjourney's commands.
-   `/settings` provides settings for Midjourney.
-   `/prefer` suffix helps to filter images by keyword.

## How to Get Realistic Faces

If you want to create realistic faces, upload a face image and use the styles parameter. You can use letsenhanc.io to enhance the face image's quality.

## Adding Text to Your Work

If you want to add text to your generated images, you can use Figma to create the text box and choose the right font. Adjust the text and voila! You have a creative image with a descriptive text that makes your design stand out.
